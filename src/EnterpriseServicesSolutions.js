                <h4>SaaS (Software As A Service):</h4>

                <p>Also called software on demand, this service lets you use all the features of a software without having to worry about its storage, installation and maintenance. The software is actually hosted on a cloud and the features or service is accessed by the user using a thin client, normally using a web browser. SaaS allows you to outsource your hardware and software maintenance and support, thus allowing you to drastically reduce your business’s operational cost.</p>
                
                <h4>IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service):</h4>

                <p>Infrastructure as a Service is a provision model in which an organization outsources the equipment used to support operations, including storage, hardware, servers and networking components. The service provider owns the equipment and is responsible for housing, running and maintaining it. The client typically pays on a per-use basis. IaaS allows you to increase or shrink the size of your cloud storage based on your needs. You don't have to worry about having dedicated servers or maintaining the IT infrastructure.</p>
                
                <h4>PaaS (Platform As A Service):</h4>

                <p>PaaS or platform as a Service lets organizations run their own applications without having to worry about the platform, infrastructure, equipment and maintenance. Ideally suited for organization who have their own software or services but lack the necessary infrastructure to operate them.</p>
                
                <h4>Managed Services:</h4>

                <p>Managed services are the practice of outsourcing day-to-day management responsibilities and functions as a strategic method for improving operations and cutting expenses. This can include outsourcing HR-activities, production support and lifecycle build/maintenance activities. Managed services are not applications that are used by the members of an organization. Instead, these are applications that are utilized by the cloud provider. Perhaps the most obvious example of a managed service is an anti-spam service.</p>
